										  This excerpt is taken from Immanuel Kant’s 1784 essay "An answer to the
											question: What Is Enlightenment?" (German: "Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist
											Aufklärung?")<sup><a href="#citation1" id="citationref1">1</a></sup>
											published at the magazine Berlinische
											Monatsschrift (Berlin Monthly). The English translation presented here is by
											Mary Campbell Smith, a work that is in the public domain. This version,

										<div style="margin-top: 1em;"></div>
										  In this essay Kant explains the meaning of Enlightenment by discussing the
										  difference between public and private use of reason. He calls for intellectual
										  independence and the courage to think for oneself, which is summarized in his
										  famous Enlightenment motto: <em>Sapere Aude</em>, meaning dare to know. Kant’s
										  essay remains strikingly relevant today, as critical reason is increasingly
										  abandoned in favor of intellectual complacency, with judgment ceded to
										  political, ideological, or technological authorities.

										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. [...] This
											immaturity is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding
											but in indecision and lack of courage to use one's own mind without
											another's guidance. Sapere aude! (Dare to know!) "Have the courage to use
											your own understanding," is therefore the motto of the enlightenment.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										Laziness and cowardice are the reasons why such a large part of mankind gladly
											remain minors all their lives, long after nature has freed them from
											external guidance. [...] It is so comfortable to be a minor. If I have a
											book that thinks for me, a pastor who acts as my conscience, a physician who
											prescribes my diet, and so on—then I have no need to exert myself. I have no
											need to think, if only I can pay [...]. Those guardians who have kindly
											taken supervision upon themselves see to it that the overwhelming majority
											of mankind—among them all women—should consider the step to maturity, not
											only as hard, but as extremely dangerous. First, these guardians make their
											domestic cattle stupid and carefully prevent the docile creatures from
											taking a single step without the leading-strings to which they have fastened
											them. Then they show them the danger that would threaten them if they should
											try to walk by themselves. Now this danger is really not very great; after
											stumbling a few times they would, at last, learn to walk. However, examples
											of such failures intimidate and generally discourage all further attempts.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										Thus it is very difficult for the individual to work himself out of the
											immaturity which has become almost second nature to him. He has even grown
											to like it, and is at first really incapable of using his own understanding
											because he has never been permitted to try it. Dogmas and formulas, these
											mechanical tools designed for reasonable use—or rather abuse—of his natural
											gifts, are the fetters of an everlasting immaturity. The man who casts them
											off would make an uncertain leap over the narrowest ditch, because he is not
											used to such free movement. That is why there are only a few men who walk
											firmly, and who have emerged from immaturity by cultivating their own minds.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										It is more nearly possible, however, for the public to enlighten itself; indeed,
											if it is only given freedom, enlightenment is almost inevitable. There will
											always be a few independent thinkers, even among the self-appointed
											guardians of the multitude. Once such men have thrown off the yoke of
											immaturity, they will spread about them the spirit of a reasonable
											appreciation of man's value and of his duty to think for himself. It is
											especially to be noted that the public which was earlier brought under the
											yoke by these men afterwards forces these very guardians to remain in
											submission, if it is so incited by some of its guardians who are themselves
											incapable of any enlightenment. That shows how pernicious it is to implant
											prejudices: they will eventually revenge themselves upon their authors or
											their authors' descendants. Therefore, a public can achieve enlightenment
											only slowly. A revolution may bring about the end of a personal despotism or
											of avaricious tyrannical oppression, but never a true reform of modes of
											thought. New prejudices will serve, in place of the old, as guidelines for
											the unthinking multitude.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										This enlightenment requires nothing but freedom—and the most innocent of all
											that may be called "freedom": freedom to make public use of one's reason in
											all matters. Now I hear the cry from all sides: "Do not argue!" The officer
											says: "Do not argue—drill!" The tax collector: "Do not argue—pay!"
											The pastor: "Do not argue—believe!" [...] We find restrictions on freedom
											everywhere. But which restriction is harmful to enlightenment? Which
											restriction is innocent, and which advances enlightenment? I reply: the
											public use of one's reason must be free at all times, and this alone can
											bring enlightenment to mankind.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										On the other hand, the private use of reason may frequently be narrowly
											restricted without especially hindering the progress of enlightenment. By
											"public use of one's reason" I mean that use which a man, as scholar, makes
											of it before the reading public. I call "private use" that use which a man
											makes of his reason in a civic post that has been entrusted to him. In some
											affairs affecting the interest of the community a certain (governmental)
											mechanism is necessary in which some members of the community remain
											passive. This creates an artificial unanimity which will serve the
											fulfillment of public objectives, or at least keep these objectives from
											being destroyed. Here arguing is not permitted: one must obey. Insofar as a
											part of this machine considers himself at the same time a member of a
											universal community—a world society of citizens—[...] he may indeed argue,
											and the affairs with which he is associated in part as a passive member will
											not suffer. Thus it would be very unfortunate if an officer on duty and
											under orders from his superiors should want to criticize the appropriateness
											or utility of his orders. He must obey. But as a scholar he could not
											rightfully be prevented from taking notice of the mistakes in the military
											service and from submitting his views to his public for its judgment. The
											citizen cannot refuse to pay the taxes levied upon him; indeed, impertinent
											censure of such taxes could be punished as a scandal that might cause
											general disobedience. Nevertheless, this man does not violate the duties of
											a citizen if, as a scholar, he publicly expresses his objections to the
											impropriety or possible injustice of such levies. A pastor, too, is bound
											to preach to his congregation in accord with the doctrines of the church
											which he serves, for he was ordained on that condition. But as a scholar he
											has full freedom, indeed the obligation, to communicate to his public all
											his carefully examined and constructive thoughts concerning errors in that
											doctrine and his proposals concerning improvement of religious dogma and
											church institutions. [...]
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										But should a society of ministers, say a Church Council, have the right to
											commit itself by oath to a certain unalterable doctrine, in order to secure
											perpetual guardianship over all its members and through them over the
											people? I say that this is quite impossible. Such a contract, concluded to
											keep all further enlightenment from humanity, is simply null and void even
											if it should be confirmed by the sovereign power, by parliaments, and the
											most solemn treaties. An epoch cannot conclude a pact that will commit
											succeeding ages, prevent them from increasing their significant insights,
											purging themselves of errors, and generally progressing in enlightenment.
											That would be a crime against human nature whose proper destiny lies
											precisely in such progress. Therefore, succeeding ages are fully entitled to
											repudiate such decisions as unauthorized and outrageous. [...]
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										A man may postpone his own enlightenment, but only for a limited period of time.
											And to give up enlightenment altogether, either for oneself or one's
											descendants, is to violate and to trample upon the sacred rights of man.
											What a person may not decide for itself may even less be decided for it by a
											monarch, for his reputation as a ruler consists precisely in the way in
											which he unites the will of the whole people within his own. If he only sees
											to it that all true or supposed (religious) improvement remains in step with
											the civic order, he can for the rest leave his subjects alone to do what
											they find necessary for the salvation of their souls. Salvation is none of
											his business; it is his business to prevent one man from forcibly keeping
											another from determining and promoting his salvation to the best of his
											ability. Indeed, it would be prejudicial to his majesty if he meddled in
											these matters and supervised the writings in which his subjects seek to
											bring their (religious) views into the open, even when he does this from
											his own highest insight, because then he exposes himself to the reproach:
											<em>Caesar non est supra grammaticos</em>.<sup><a href="#footnotea" id="fnrefa">a</a></sup> [...]
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										When we ask, Are we now living in an enlightened age? the answer is, No, but we
											live in an age of enlightenment. As matters now stand it is still far from
											true that men are already capable of using their own reason in religious
											matters confidently and correctly without external guidance. Still, we have
											some obvious indications that the field of working toward the goal
											(of religious truth) is now opened. What is more, the hindrances against
											general enlightenment or the emergence from self-imposed immaturity are
											gradually diminishing. In this respect this is the age of the enlightenment [...].
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										A prince ought not to deem it beneath his dignity to state that he considers it
											his duty not to dictate anything to his subjects in religious matters, but
											to leave them complete freedom. If he repudiates the arrogant word
											"tolerant", he is himself enlightened; he deserves to be praised by a
											grateful world and posterity as that man who was the first to liberate
											mankind from dependence, at least on the government, and let everybody use
											his own reason in matters of conscience. Under his reign, honorable pastors,
											acting as scholars and regardless of the duties of their office, can freely
											and openly publish their ideas to the world for inspection, although they
											deviate here and there from accepted doctrine. This is even more true of
											every person not restrained by any oath of office. [...] When one does not
											deliberately attempt to keep men in barbarism, they will gradually work out
											of that condition by themselves.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										I have emphasized the main point of the enlightenment—man's emergence from his
											self-imposed immaturity—primarily in religious matters, because our rulers
											have no interest in playing the guardian to their subjects in the arts and
											sciences. Above all, immaturity in religion is not only the most harmful but
											the most dishonorable. But the disposition of a sovereign ruler who favors
											freedom in the arts and sciences goes even further: he knows that there is
											no danger in permitting his subjects to make public use of their reason and
											to publish their ideas concerning a better constitution, as well as candid
											criticism of existing basic laws. [...]
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										But only the man who is himself enlightened, who is not afraid of shadows, and
											who commands at the same time a well disciplined and numerous army as
											guarantor of public peace—only he can say what (the sovereign of) a free
											state cannot dare to say: "Argue as much as you like, and about what you
											like, but obey!" Thus we observe here as elsewhere in human affairs, in
											which almost everything is paradoxical, a surprising and unexpected course
											of events: a large degree of civic freedom appears to be of advantage to the
											intellectual freedom of the people, yet at the same time it establishes
											insurmountable barriers. A lesser degree of civic freedom, however, creates
											room to let that free spirit expand to the limits of its capacity. Nature,
											then, has carefully cultivated the seed within the hard core—namely the urge
											for and the vocation of free thought. And this free thought gradually reacts
											back on the modes of thought of the people, and men become more and more
											capable of acting in freedom. At last free thought acts even on the
											fundamentals of government and the state finds it agreeable to treat man,
											who is now more than a machine, in accord with his dignity.
