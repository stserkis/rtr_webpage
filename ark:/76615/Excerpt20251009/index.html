										  In this excerpt, Mill argues that the concept of Utility can serve as the
                                          foundation of morality. He also addresses several criticisms of the doctrine,
                                          including the claims that it reduces morality to mere physical pleasure, that
                                          it is a godless doctrine, and that it is unrealistic to expect individuals to
                                          assess the consequences of their actions in every situation.

										The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or the Greatest
                                            Happiness Principle, holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend
                                            to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of
                                            happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by
                                            unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure. [...] Pleasure, and
                                            freedom from pain, are the only things desirable as ends; and that all
                                            desirable things [...] are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in
                                            themselves, or as means to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention of
                                            pain.

										Now, such a theory of life excites in many minds [...] inveterate dislike. To
                                            suppose that life has (as they express it) no higher end than pleasure—no
                                            better and nobler object of desire and pursuit—they designate as utterly
                                            mean and grovelling; as a doctrine worthy only of pigs, to whom the
                                            followers of Epicurus were, at a very early period, contemptuously likened.
                                            [...]
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										When thus attacked, the Epicureans have always answered, that it is not they,
                                            but their accusers, who represent human nature in a degrading light; since
                                            the accusation supposes human beings to be capable of no pleasures except
                                            those of which pigs are capable. If this supposition were true, the charge
                                            could not be denied, but would then be no longer an accusation; for if the
                                            sources of pleasure were precisely the same to human beings and to pigs, the
                                            rule of life which is good enough for the one would be good enough for the
                                            other. The comparison of the Epicurean life to that of beasts is felt as
                                            degrading, precisely because a beast's pleasures do not satisfy a human
                                            being's conceptions of happiness. Human beings have faculties more elevated
                                            than the animal appetites, and when once made conscious of them, do not
                                            regard anything as happiness which does not include their gratification. I
                                            do not, indeed, consider the Epicureans to have been by any means faultless
                                            in drawing out their scheme of consequences from the utilitarian principle.
                                            To do this in any sufficient manner, many Stoic, as well as Christian
                                            elements require to be included. But there is no known Epicurean theory of
                                            life which does not assign to the pleasures of the intellect; of the
                                            feelings and imagination, and of the moral sentiments, a much higher value
                                            as pleasures than to those of mere sensation. [...] It is quite compatible
                                            with the principle of utility to recognise the fact, that some
                                            <em>kinds</em> of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.
                                            It would be absurd that while, in estimating all other things, quality is
                                            considered as well as quantity, the estimation of pleasures should be
                                            supposed to depend on quantity alone.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										If I am asked, what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures, or what makes
                                            one pleasure more valuable than another, merely as a pleasure, except its
                                            being greater in amount, there is but one possible answer. Of two pleasures,
                                            if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give
                                            a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to
                                            prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure. If one of the two is, by
                                            those who are competently acquainted with both, placed so far above the
                                            other that they prefer it, even though knowing it to be attended with a
                                            greater amount of discontent, and would not resign it for any quantity of
                                            the other pleasure which their nature is capable of, we are justified in
                                            ascribing to the preferred enjoyment a superiority in quality, so far
                                            outweighing quantity as to render it, in comparison, of small account.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										Now it is an unquestionable fact that those who are equally acquainted with, and
                                            equally capable of appreciating and enjoying, both, do give a most marked
                                            preference to the manner of existence which employs their higher faculties.
                                            Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower
                                            animals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast's pleasures; no
                                            intelligent human being would consent to be a fool [...] even though they
                                            should be persuaded that the fool [...] is better satisfied with his life
                                            than they are with theirs. [...] Whoever supposes that this preference takes
                                            place at a sacrifice of happiness [...] confounds the two very different
                                            ideas, of happiness, and content. It is indisputable that the being whose
                                            capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of having them
                                            fully satisfied; and a being whose capacities of enjoyment are high will
                                            always feel that any happiness which he can look for, as the world is
                                            constituted, is imperfect. But he can learn to bear its imperfections, if
                                            they are at all bearable; and they will not make him envy the being who is
                                            indeed unconscious of the imperfections, but only because he feels not at
                                            all the good which those imperfections qualify. It is better to be a human
                                            being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied
                                            than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, is of a different
                                            opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question. The
                                            other party to the comparison knows both sides.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										It may be objected, that many who are capable of the higher pleasures,
                                            occasionally, under the influence of temptation, postpone them to the lower.
                                            But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic
                                            superiority of the higher. Men often, from weakness of character, make their
                                            election for the nearer good, though they know it to be the less valuable
                                            [...]. They pursue sensual indulgences to the injury of health, though
                                            perfectly aware that health is the greater good. It may be further objected,
                                            that many who begin with youthful enthusiasm for everything noble, as they
                                            advance in years sink into indolence and selfishness. But I do not believe
                                            that those who undergo this very common change, voluntarily choose the lower
                                            description of pleasures in preference to the higher. I believe that before
                                            they devote themselves exclusively to the one, they have already become
                                            incapable of the other. Capacity for the nobler feelings is in most natures
                                            a very tender plant, easily killed, not only by hostile influences, but by
                                            mere want of sustenance; and in the majority of young persons it speedily
                                            dies away if the occupations to which their position in life has devoted
                                            them, and the society into which it has thrown them, are not favourable to
                                            keeping that higher capacity in exercise. Men lose their high aspirations
                                            as they lose their intellectual tastes, because they have not time or
                                            opportunity for indulging them; and they addict themselves to inferior
                                            pleasures, not because they deliberately prefer them, but because they are
                                            either the only ones to which they have access, or the only ones which they
                                            are any longer capable of enjoying. [...]

										[...] A necessary part of a perfectly just conception of Utility or Happiness
                                            [...] is not the agent's own greatest happiness, but the greatest amount of
                                            happiness altogether; and if it may possibly be doubted whether a noble
                                            character is always the happier for its nobleness, there can be no doubt
                                            that it makes other people happier, and that the world in general is
                                            immensely a gainer by it. Utilitarianism, therefore, could only attain its

                                            nature of things admits, to the whole sentient creation.

										Against this doctrine, however, arises another class of objectors, who say that
                                            happiness, in any form, cannot be the rational purpose of human life and
                                            action; because, in the first place, it is unattainable: and they
                                            contemptuously ask, What right do you have to be happy? [...] Next, they
                                            say, that men can do <em>without</em> happiness; [...]
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										The first of these objections would go to the root of the matter were it well
                                            founded; for if no happiness is to be had at all by human beings, the
                                            attainment of it cannot be the end of morality, or of any rational conduct.
                                            Though, even in that case, something might still be said for the utilitarian
                                            theory; since utility includes not solely the pursuit of happiness, but the
                                            prevention or mitigation of unhappiness; [...] When, however, it is thus
                                            positively asserted to be impossible that human life should be happy, the
                                            assertion, if not something like a verbal quibble, is at least an
                                            exaggeration. If by happiness be meant a continuity of highly pleasurable
                                            excitement, it is evident enough that this is impossible. A state of exalted
                                            pleasure lasts only moments, or in some cases, and with some intermissions,
                                            hours or days, and is the occasional brilliant flash of enjoyment, not its
                                            permanent and steady flame. Of this the philosophers who have taught that
                                            happiness is the end of life were as fully aware as those who taunt them.
                                            The happiness which they meant was not a life of rapture, but moments of
                                            such, in an existence made up of few and transitory pains, many and various
                                            pleasures, with a decided predominance of the active over the passive, and
                                            having as the foundation of the whole, not to expect more from life than it
                                            is capable of bestowing. A life thus composed, to those who have been
                                            fortunate enough to obtain it, has always appeared worthy of the name of
                                            happiness. [...]

										The objectors perhaps may doubt whether human beings, if taught to consider
                                            happiness as the end of life, would be satisfied with such a moderate share
                                            of it. But great numbers of mankind have been satisfied with much less. The
                                            main constituents of a satisfied life appear to be two, either of which by
                                            itself is often found sufficient for the purpose: tranquillity, and
                                            excitement. With much tranquillity, many find that they can be content with
                                            very little pleasure: with much excitement, many can reconcile themselves to
                                            a considerable quantity of pain. There is assuredly no inherent
                                            impossibility in enabling even the mass of mankind to unite both; since the
                                            two are so far from being incompatible that they are in natural alliance,
                                            the prolongation of either being a preparation for, and exciting a wish for,
                                            the other. [...] When people who are well off do not find in life sufficient
                                            enjoyment [...], the cause generally is, caring for nobody but themselves.
                                            [...] Next to selfishness, the principal cause which makes life
                                            unsatisfactory, is want of mental cultivation. A cultivated mind [...] finds
                                            sources of inexhaustible interest in all that surrounds it; in the objects
                                            of nature, the achievements of art, the imaginations of poetry, the
                                            incidents of history, the ways of mankind past and present, and their
                                            prospects in the future. [...]

                                            virtue, which is better than happiness, I ask, would the sacrifice be made

                                            In the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth, we read the complete spirit of the
                                            ethics of utility. To do as one would be done by, and to love one's
                                            neighbour as oneself, constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian
                                            morality. As the means of making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility
                                            would enjoin, first, that laws and social arrangements should place the
                                            happiness, or (as speaking practically it may be called) the interest, of
                                            every individual, as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the
                                            whole; and secondly, that education and opinion, which have so vast a power
                                            over human character, should so use that power as to establish in the mind
                                            of every individual an indissoluble association between his own happiness
                                            and the good of the whole. [...]

                                        The objectors to utilitarianism [...] sometimes find fault with its standard as
                                            being too high for humanity. They say it is exacting too much to require
                                            that people shall always act from the inducement of promoting the general
                                            interests of society. But this is to mistake the very meaning of a standard
                                            of morals, and to confound the rule of action with the motive of it. It is
                                            the business of ethics to tell us what are our duties, or by what test we
                                            may know them; but no system of ethics requires that the sole motive of all
                                            we do shall be a feeling of duty; on the contrary, ninety-nine hundredths
                                            of all our actions are done from other motives, and rightly so done, if the
                                            rule of duty does not condemn them. [...] The motive has nothing to do with
                                            the morality of the action, though much with the worth of the agent. He who
                                            saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether
                                            his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble.<sup><a href="#footnotea" id="fnrefa">a</a></sup>
                                            [...] But to speak only of actions done from the motive of duty, and in
                                            direct obedience to principle: it is a misapprehension of the utilitarian
                                            mode of thought, to conceive it as implying that people should fix their
                                            minds upon so wide a generality as the world, or society at large. The great
                                            majority of good actions are intended, not for the benefit of the world, but
                                            for that of individuals, of which the good of the world is made up; and the
                                            thoughts of the most virtuous man need not on these occasions travel beyond
                                            the particular persons concerned, except so far as is necessary to assure
                                            himself that in benefiting them he is not violating the rights [...] of
                                            anyone else. The multiplication of happiness is, according to the utilitarian
                                            ethics, the object of virtue: the occasions on which any person
                                            (except one in a thousand) has it in his power to do this on an extended
                                            scale, in other words, to be a public benefactor, are but exceptional; and
                                            on these occasions alone is he called on to consider public utility; in
                                            every other case, private utility, the interest or happiness of some few
                                            persons, is all he has to attend to.  Those alone the influence of whose
                                            actions extends to society in general, need concern themselves habitually
                                            about so large an object. [...]

                                        [...] It is often affirmed that utilitarianism renders men cold and
                                            unsympathizing; that it chills their moral feelings towards individuals;
                                            that it makes them regard only the dry and hard consideration of the
                                            consequences of actions, not taking into their moral estimate the qualities
                                            from which those actions emanate. If the assertion means that they do not
                                            allow their judgment respecting the rightness or wrongness of an action to
                                            be influenced by their opinion of the qualities of the person who does it,
                                            this is a complaint not against utilitarianism, but against having any
                                            standard of morality at all; for certainly no known ethical standard decides
                                            an action to be good or bad because it is done by a good or a bad man, still
                                            less because done by an amiable, a brave, or a benevolent man or the
                                            contrary. These considerations are relevant, not to the estimation of
                                            actions, but of persons; and there is nothing in the utilitarian theory
                                            inconsistent with the fact that there are other things which interest us in
                                            persons besides the rightness and wrongness of their actions. The Stoics,
                                            indeed, with the paradoxical misuse of language which was part of their
                                            system, and by which they strove to raise themselves above all concern about
                                            anything but virtue, were fond of saying that he who has that has
                                            everything; that he, and only he, is rich, is beautiful, is a king. But no
                                            claim of this description is made for the virtuous man by the utilitarian
                                            doctrine. Utilitarians are quite aware that there are other desirable
                                            possessions and qualities besides virtue, and are perfectly willing to
                                            allow to all of them their full worth. They are also aware that a right
                                            action does not necessarily indicate a virtuous character, and that actions
                                            which are blameable often proceed from qualities entitled to praise. When
                                            this is apparent in any particular case, it modifies their estimation, not
                                            certainly of the act, but of the agent. [...]

                                        We not uncommonly hear the doctrine of utility denounced as a <em>godless</em>
                                            doctrine. If it be necessary to say anything at all against so mere an
                                            assumption, we may say that the question depends upon what idea we have
                                            formed of the moral character of the Deity. If it be a true belief that God
                                            desires, above all things, the happiness of his creatures, and that this was
                                            his purpose in their creation, utility is not only not a godless doctrine,
                                            but more profoundly religious than any other. If it be meant that
                                            utilitarianism does not recognise the revealed will of God as the supreme
                                            law of morals, I answer, that an utilitarian who believes in the perfect
                                            goodness and wisdom of God, necessarily believes that whatever God has
                                            thought fit to reveal on the subject of morals, must fulfil the requirements
                                            of utility in a supreme degree. [...]

                                        [...] Defenders of utility often find themselves called upon to reply to such
                                            objections as this—that there is not time, previous to action, for
                                            calculating and weighing the effects of any line of conduct on the general
                                            happiness. This is exactly as if any one were to say that it is impossible
                                            to guide our conduct by Christianity, because there is not time, on every
                                            occasion on which anything has to be done, to read through the Old and New
                                            Testaments. The answer to the objection is, that there has been ample time,
                                            namely, the whole past duration of the human species. During all that time
                                            mankind have been learning by experience the tendencies of actions; on which
                                            experience all the prudence, as well as all the morality of life, is
                                            dependent. People talk as if the commencement of this course of experience
                                            had hitherto been put off, and as if, at the moment when some man feels
                                            tempted to meddle with the property or life of another, he had to begin
                                            considering for the first time whether murder and theft are injurious to
                                            human happiness. Even then I do not think that he would find the question
                                            very puzzling [...] It is truly a whimsical supposition, that if mankind
                                            were agreed in considering utility to be the test of morality, they would
                                            remain without any agreement as to what is useful [...]. [...] That the
                                            received code of ethics is by no means of divine right; and that mankind
                                            have still much to learn as to the effects of actions on the general
                                            happiness, I admit, or rather, earnestly maintain. The corollaries from the
                                            principle of utility, like the precepts of every practical art, admit of
                                            indefinite improvement, and, in a progressive state of the human mind, their
                                            improvement is perpetually going on. But to consider the rules of morality
                                            as improvable, is one thing; to pass over the intermediate generalizations
                                            entirely, and endeavour to test each individual action directly by the first
                                            principle, is another. It is a strange notion that the acknowledgment of a
                                            first principle is inconsistent with the admission of secondary ones. To
                                            inform a traveller respecting the place of his ultimate destination, is not
                                            to forbid the use of landmarks and direction-posts on the way. The
                                            proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality, does not mean
                                            that no road ought to be laid down to that goal, or that persons going there
                                            should not be advised to take one direction rather than another. [...]
                                            Nobody argues that the art of navigation is not founded on astronomy,
                                            because sailors cannot wait to calculate the Nautical Almanack. Being
                                            rational creatures, they go to sea with it ready calculated; and all
                                            rational creatures go out upon the sea of life with their minds made up on
                                            the common questions of right and wrong, as well as on many of the far more
                                            difficult questions of wise and foolish. [...] Whatever we adopt as the
                                            fundamental principle of morality, we require subordinate principles to
                                            apply it by [...]. [...]

                                        [...] We are told that an utilitarian will be apt to make his own particular
                                            case an exception to moral rules, and, when under temptation, will see an
                                            utility in the breach of a rule, greater than he will see in its observance.
                                            But is utility the only creed which is able to furnish us with excuses for
                                            evil doing, and means of cheating our own conscience? They are afforded in
                                            abundance by all doctrines which recognise as a fact in morals the existence
                                            of conflicting considerations; which all doctrines do, that have been
                                            believed by sane persons. It is not the fault of any creed, but of the
                                            complicated nature of human affairs, that rules of conduct cannot be so
                                            framed as to require no exceptions, and that hardly any kind of action can
                                            safely be laid down as either always obligatory or always condemnable. There
                                            is no ethical creed which does not temper the rigidity of its laws, by
                                            giving a certain latitude, under the moral responsibility of the agent, for
                                            accommodation to peculiarities of circumstances; and under every creed,
                                            at the opening thus made, self-deception and dishonest reasoning get in.
                                            There exists no moral system under which there do not arise unequivocal
                                            cases of conflicting obligation. These are the real difficulties, the knotty
                                            points both in the theory of ethics, and in the conscientious guidance of
                                            personal conduct. They are overcome practically with greater or with less
                                            success according to the intellect and virtue of the individual; but it can
                                            hardly be pretended that any one will be the less qualified for dealing with
                                            them, from possessing an ultimate standard to which conflicting rights and
                                            duties can be referred. If utility is the ultimate source of moral
                                            obligations, utility may be invoked to decide between them when their
                                            demands are incompatible. Though the application of the standard may be
                                            difficult, it is better than none at all: while in other systems, the moral
                                            laws all claiming independent authority, there is no common arbiter entitled
                                            to interfere between them; their claims to precedence one over another rest
                                            on little better than sophistry, and unless determined, as they generally
                                            are, by the unacknowledged influence of considerations of utility, afford a
                                            free scope for the action of personal desires and partialities. We must
                                            remember that only in these cases of conflict between secondary principles
                                            is it requisite that first principles should be appealed to. There is no
                                            case of moral obligation in which some secondary principle is not involved;
                                            and if only one, there can seldom be any real doubt which one it is, in the
                                            mind of any person by whom the principle itself is recognized.

                                            objected to this passage, saying, "Surely the rightness or wrongness of
                                            saving a man from drowning does depend very much upon the motive with which
                                            it is done. Suppose that a tyrant, when his enemy jumped into the sea to
                                            escape from him, saved him from drowning simply in order that he might
                                            inflict upon him more exquisite tortures, would it make things clearer to
                                            speak of that rescue as 'a morally right action?' [...]"<br><br>

                                            I submit, that he who saves another from drowning in order to kill him by
                                            torture afterwards, does not differ only in motive from him who does the
                                            same thing from duty or benevolence; the act itself is different. The rescue
                                            of the man is, in the case supposed, only the necessary first step of an act
                                            far more atrocious than leaving him to drown would have been. Had Mr. Davis
                                            said, "The rightness or wrongness of saving a man from drowning does depend
                                            very much"—not upon the motive, but—"upon the <em>intention</em>" no
                                            utilitarian would have differed from him. Mr. Davis, by an oversight [...]
                                            has in this case confounded the very different ideas of Motive and
                                            Intention. [...] The morality of the action depends entirely upon the
                                            intention—that is, upon what the agent <em>wills to do</em>. But the motive,
                                            that is, the feeling which makes him will so to do, [...] makes a great
                                            difference in our moral estimation of the agent. [...]
