										  In this excerpt, Poincaré presents his views on what constitutes objective
                                        knowledge, the nature of science, and the extent to which reality is accessible.
                                        His treatment of these questions lays the foundation for what is currently known
                                        as structural realism. The passage also includes insights into the relative
                                        nature of space and time, along with a nuanced discussion of the transition
                                        from the Ptolemaic to the Copernican system.

										[...] What is the objective value of science? And first what should we
                                          understand by objectivity?
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										What guarantees the objectivity of the world in which we live is that this world
                                          is common to us with other thinking beings. Through the communications that we
                                          have with other men, we receive from them ready-made reasonings; we know that
                                          these reasonings do not come from us and at the same time we recognize in them
                                          the work of reasonable beings like ourselves. And as these reasonings appear
                                          to fit the world of our sensations, we think we may infer that these
                                          reasonable beings have seen the same thing as we; thus [...] we know we have
                                          not been dreaming.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										Such, therefore, is the first condition of objectivity; what is objective must
                                          be common to many minds and consequently transmissible from one to the other,
                                          and as this transmission can only come about by [...] 'discourse' [...],
                                          we are even forced to conclude: no discourse, no objectivity.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										The sensations of others will be for us a world eternally closed. We have no
                                          means of verifying that the sensation I call red is the same as that which my
                                          neighbor calls red.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										Suppose that a cherry and a red poppy produce on me the sensation A and on him
                                          the sensation B and that, on the contrary, a leaf produces on me the sensation
                                          B and on him the sensation A. It is clear we shall never know anything about
                                          it; since I shall call red the sensation A and green the sensation B, while he
                                          will call the first green and the second red. In compensation, what we shall
                                          be able to ascertain is that, for him as for me, the cherry and the red poppy
                                          produce the <em>same</em> sensation, since he gives the same name to the
                                          sensations he feels and I do the same.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										Sensations are therefore intransmissible, or rather all that is pure quality in
                                          them is intransmissible and forever impenetrable. But it is not the same with
                                          relations between these sensations.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										From this point of view, all that is objective is devoid of all quality and is
                                          only pure relation. Certainly, I shall not go so far as to say that
                                          objectivity is only pure quantity (this would be to particularize too far the
                                          nature of the relations in question), but we understand how someone could have
                                          been carried away into saying that the world is only a differential equation.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										With due reserve regarding this paradoxical proposition, we must nevertheless
                                          admit that nothing is objective which is not transmissible, and consequently
                                          that the relations between the sensations can alone have an objective value.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										Perhaps it will be said that the aesthetic emotion, which is common to all
                                          mankind, is proof that the qualities of our sensations are also the same for
                                          all men and hence are objective. But if we think about this, we shall see that
                                          the proof is not complete; what is proved is that this emotion is aroused in
                                          John as in James by the sensations to which James and John give the same name
                                          or by the corresponding combinations of these sensations; either because this
                                          emotion is associated in John with the sensation A, which John calls red,
                                          while parallelly it is associated in James with the sensation B, which James
                                          calls red; or better because this emotion is aroused, not by the qualities
                                          themselves of the sensations, but by the harmonious combination of their
                                          relations of which we undergo the unconscious impression.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										Such a sensation is beautiful, not because it possesses such a quality, but
                                          because it occupies such a place in the fabric of our associations of ideas,
                                          so that it can not be excited without putting in motion the 'receiver'
                                          which is at the other end of the thread and which corresponds to the artistic
                                          emotion.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										Whether we take the moral, the aesthetic or the scientific point of view, it is
                                          always the same thing. Nothing is objective except what is identical for all;
                                          now we can only speak of such an identity if a comparison is possible, and can
                                          be translated into a 'money of exchange' capable of transmission from one
                                          mind to another. Nothing, therefore, will have objective value except what is
                                          transmissible by 'discourse,' that is, intelligible.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										But this is only one side of the question. An absolutely disordered aggregate
                                          could not have objective value since it would be unintelligible, but no more
                                          can a well-ordered assemblage have it, if it does not correspond to sensations
                                          really experienced. [...] Two conditions are therefore to be fulfilled, and if
                                          the first separates reality<sup><a href="#footnotea" id="fnrefa">a</a></sup>
                                          from the dream, the second distinguishes it
                                          from the romance.
										</p>
                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        Now what is science? I have explained in the preceding article, it is before all
                                          a classification, a manner of bringing together facts which appearances
                                          separate, though they were bound together by some natural and hidden kinship.
                                          Science, in other words, is a system of relations. Now we have just said, it
                                          is in the relations alone that objectivity must be sought; it would be vain to
                                          seek it in beings considered as isolated from one another.
										</p>
                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        To say that science cannot have objective value since it teaches us only
                                          relations, this is to reason backward, since, precisely, it is relations alone
                                          which can be regarded as objective.
										</p>
                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        External objects, for instance, for which the word <em>object</em> was
                                          invented, are really <em>objects</em> and not fleeting and fugitive
                                          appearances, because they are not only groups of sensations, but groups
                                          cemented by a constant bond. It is this bond, and this bond alone, which is
                                          the object in itself, and this bond is a relation.
										</p>
                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        Therefore, when we ask what is the objective value of science, that does not
                                          mean: Does science teach us the true nature of things? but it means: Does it
                                          teach us the true relations of things?
										</p>
                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        To the first question, no one would hesitate to reply, no; but I think we may go
                                          farther; not only science can not teach us the nature of things; but nothing
                                          is capable of teaching it to us, and if any god knew it, he could not find
                                          words to express it. Not only can we not divine the response, but if it were
                                          given to us we could understand nothing of it; I ask myself even whether we
                                          really understand the question.
										</p>
                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        When, therefore, a scientific theory pretends to teach us what heat is, or what
                                          is electricity, or life, it is condemned beforehand; all it can give us is
                                          only a crude image. It is, therefore, provisional and crumbling.
										</p>
                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        The first question being out of reason, the second remains. Can science teach us
                                          the true relations of things? What it joins together should that be put apart,
                                          what it puts apart should that be joined together?
										</p>
                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        To understand the meaning of this new question, it is needful to refer to what
                                          was said above on the conditions of objectivity. Have these relations an
                                          objective value? That means: Are these relations the same for all? Will they
                                          still be the same for those who shall come after us?
										</p>
                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        It is clear that they are not the same for the scientist and the ignorant
                                          person. But that is unimportant, because if the ignorant person does not see
                                          them all at once, the scientist may succeed in making him see them by a series
                                          of experiments and reasonings. The thing essential is that there are points on
                                          which all those acquainted with the experiments made can reach accord.

                                        The question is to know whether this accord will be durable and whether it will
                                          persist for our successors. It may be asked whether the unions that the
                                          science of today makes will be confirmed by the science of tomorrow. To affirm
                                          that it will be so we can not invoke any <em>a priori</em> reason; but this is
                                          a question of fact, and science has already lived long enough for us to be
                                          able to find out by asking its history whether the edifices it builds stand
                                          the test of time, or whether they are only ephemeral constructions.

                                        Now what do we see? At first sight, it seems to us that the theories last
                                          only a day and that ruins upon ruins accumulate. Today the theories are born,
                                          tomorrow they are the fashion, the day after tomorrow they are classic, the
                                          fourth day they are obsolete, and the fifth they are forgotten. But if we look
                                          more closely, we see that what thus succumb are the theories properly so
                                          called, those which pretend to teach us what things are. But there is in them
                                          something which usually survives. If one of them taught us a true relation,
                                          this relation is definitively acquired, and it will be found again under a new
                                          disguise in the other theories which will successively come to reign in place
                                          of the old.

                                        Take only a single example: The theory of the undulations of the ether taught us
                                          that light is a motion; today fashion favors the electromagnetic theory which
                                          teaches us that light is a current. We do not consider whether we could
                                          reconcile them and say that light is a current, and that this current is a
                                          motion. As it is probable in any case that this motion would not be identical
                                          with that which the partisans of the old theory presume, we might think
                                          ourselves justified in saying that this old theory is dethroned. And yet
                                          something of it remains, since between the hypothetical currents which Maxwell
                                          supposes there are the same relations as between the hypothetical motions that
                                          Fresnel supposed. There is, therefore, something which remains over and this
                                          something is the essential. This it is which explains how we see the present
                                          physicists pass without any embarrassment from the language of Fresnel to that
                                          of Maxwell. Doubtless many connections that were believed well established
                                          have been abandoned, but the greatest number remain and it would seem must
                                          remain.

                                        And for these, then, what is the measure of their objectivity? Well, it is
                                          precisely the same as for our belief in external objects. These latter are
                                          real in this, that the sensations they make us feel appear to us as united to
                                          each other by I know not what indestructible cement and not by the hazard of a
                                          day. In the same way science reveals to us between phenomena other bonds finer
                                          but not less solid; these are threads so slender that they long remained
                                          unperceived, but once noticed there remains no way of not seeing them; they
                                          are therefore not less real than those which give their reality to external
                                          objects; small matter that they are more recently known, since neither can
                                          perish before the other.

                                        It may be said, for instance, that the ether is no less real than any external
                                          body; to say this body exists is to say there is between the color of this
                                          body, its taste, its smell, an intimate bond, solid and persistent; to say the
                                          ether exists is to say there is a natural kinship between all the optical
                                          phenomena, and neither of the two propositions has less value than the other.

                                        And the scientific syntheses have in a sense even more reality than those of the
                                          ordinary senses, since they embrace more terms and tend to absorb in them the
                                          partial syntheses.

                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        It will be said that science is only a classification and that a classification
                                          cannot be true, but convenient. But it is true that it is convenient, it is
                                          true that it is so not only for me, but for all men; it is true that it will
                                          remain convenient for our descendants; it is true finally that this can not be
                                          by chance.

                                        In sum, the sole objective reality consists in the relations of things whence
                                          results the universal harmony. Doubtless these relations, this harmony, could
                                          not be conceived outside of a mind which conceives them. But they are
                                          nevertheless objective because they are, will become, or will remain, common
                                          to all thinking beings.

                                          will give us at the same time a chance to make clear what precedes by an

                                        No, there is no absolute space; these two contradictory propositions:
                                          'The earth turns round' and 'The earth does not turn round' are,
                                          therefore, neither of them more true than the other. To affirm one while
                                          denying the other, <em>in the kinematic sense</em>, would be to admit the

                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        But if the one reveals true relations that the other hides from us, we can
                                          nevertheless regard it as physically more true than the other, since it has a
                                          richer content. Now in this regard no doubt is possible.

                                        Behold the apparent daily motion of the stars, and the daily motion of the other
                                          heavenly bodies, and besides, the flattening of the earth, the rotation of
                                          Foucault's pendulum, the rotation of cyclones, the trade-winds, and so on.
                                          For the Ptolemaist all these phenomena have no bond between them; for the
                                          Copernican they are produced by the one same cause. In saying, the earth turns
                                          round, I affirm that all these phenomena have an intimate relation, and
                                          <em>that is true</em>, and that remains true, although there is not and can

                                        So much for the rotation of the earth upon itself; what shall we say of its
                                          revolution around the sun? Here again, we have three phenomena which for the
                                          Ptolemaist are absolutely independent and which for the Copernican are
                                          referred back to the same origin; they are the apparent displacements of the
                                          planets on the celestial sphere, the aberration of the fixed stars, the
                                          parallax of these same stars. Is it by chance that all the planets admit an
                                          inequality whose period is a year, and that this period is precisely equal to
                                          that of aberration, precisely equal besides to that of parallax? To adopt
                                          Ptolemy's system is to answer, yes; to adopt that of Copernicus is to answer,
                                          no; this is to affirm that there is a bond between the three phenomena, and
                                          that also is true, although there is no absolute space.

                                        In Ptolemy's system, the motions of the heavenly bodies cannot be explained by
                                          the action of central forces, celestial mechanics is impossible. The intimate
                                          relations that celestial mechanics reveals to us between all the celestial
                                          phenomena are true relations; to affirm the immobility of the earth would be

                                        We cannot know all facts and it is necessary to choose those which are worthy of
                                          being known. According to Tolstoi, scientists make this choice at random,
                                          instead of making it, which would be reasonable, with a view to practical
                                          applications. On the contrary, scientists think that certain facts are more
                                          interesting than others, because they complete an unfinished harmony, or
                                          because they make one foresee a great number of other facts. If they are
                                          wrong, if this hierarchy of facts that they implicitly postulate is only an
                                          idle illusion, there could be no science for its own sake, and consequently
                                          there could be no science. As for me, I believe they are right, and, for
                                          example, I have shown above what is the high value of astronomical facts, not
                                          because they are capable of practical applications, but because they are the
                                          most instructive of all.

                                        All that is not thought is pure nothingness; since we can think only thoughts
                                          and all the words we use to speak of things can express only thoughts, to say
                                          there is something other than thought, is therefore an affirmation which can
                                          have no meaning.

                                        And yet—strange contradiction for those who believe in time—geologic history
                                          shows us that life is only a short episode between two eternities of death,
                                          and that, even in this episode, conscious thought has lasted and will last
                                          only a moment. Thought is only a gleam in the midst of a long night.

                                        But it is this gleam which is everything.

										  <strong><span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 0.8em; color: #7f888f;">a</span></strong> I here use the word real as a synonym
                                          of objective; I thus conform to common usage; perhaps I am wrong, our dreams are
                                          real, but they are not objective.
