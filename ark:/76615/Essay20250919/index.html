										It is through direct or indirect perception of physical phenomena that human
                                            beings access the world around them. The regularities and patterns that
                                            emerge from observation call for a systematic description, which in turn
                                            requires the introduction of concepts sufficiently abstract to be embedded
                                            within a consistent theoretical framework. While the reality of percepts can
                                            readily be affirmed on an empirical basis, the reality of concepts poses an
                                            ontological problem that dates back to the origins of philosophy.

										The view that refrains from attributing any reality to scientific concepts and
                                            their relations is known in contemporary philosophy as
                                            <em>instrumentalism</em>. According to this view, scientific theories
                                            function as predictive instruments rather than as descriptions of reality.
                                            In contrast, <em>realism</em> (short for <em>scientific realism</em>) holds
                                            that scientific concepts such as mass, force, and charge, together with the
                                            relations they enter into, correspond to reality or at least provide a close
                                            approximation of it.

										Instrumentalism, due to its agnostic character, remains a safe position as long
                                            as questions about the ontological status of scientific concepts are set
                                            aside. Realism, on the other hand, faces significant challenges,
                                            particularly in light of developments in modern physics such as quantum
                                            mechanics, the branch of physics concerned with the subatomic world, and
                                            cosmology, which studies the nature and development of the universe
                                            macroscopically.

										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										The aim of this essay is to address the limitations that realism faces and to
                                            defend an alternative perspective, known as <em>structural realism</em>
                                            (short for <em>structural scientific realism</em>). Structural realism, a
                                            term coined by John Worrall,<sup><a href="#citation1" id="citationref1">1</a></sup>
                                            holds that reality manifests
                                            itself through the mathematical relations among scientific concepts. An
                                            early formulation of this view appears in the writings of Henri Poincaré,
                                            who argued that:<sup><a href="#citation2" id="citationref2">2</a></sup>
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										\qu{Science [...] is a system of relations. [...] it is in the relations alone
                                            that objectivity must be sought; it would be vain to seek it in beings
                                            considered as isolated from one another.}
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4; text-indent: 0;">
										To the question of whether science reveals the true nature of things,
                                            Poincaré answered:<sup><a href="#citation2" id="citationref2">2</a></sup>
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										\qu{Not only science cannot teach us the nature of things; but nothing is
                                            capable of teaching it to us.}
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4; text-indent: 0;">
										This essay focuses on this version of structural realism, according to
                                            which there is a barrier to accessing reality beyond its structure, whereas
                                            another version claims that reality itself is nothing but structure.

										A concept that plays a central role in quantum mechanics is
                                            <em>complementarity</em>. In its broader sense, complementarity refers to a
                                            trade-off in the compatibility between two measured properties, which, in
                                            its most pronounced form, results in their mutual exclusivity.
                                            Complementarity is clearly demonstrated in photography: adjusting the
                                            aperture of a camera lens, while keeping all other settings constant,
                                            creates a trade-off between brightness and depth of field (illustrated in
                                            Figure 1). A smaller aperture allows less light to reach
                                            the sensor, resulting in a darker image but with greater depth of field,
                                            meaning that objects at varying distances remain in focus. Conversely, a
                                            wider aperture lets in more light, producing a brighter image but reducing
                                            the depth of field, so only a narrow range remains sharp while the rest
                                            becomes blurred. It should be emphasized that complementarity is not a
                                            consequence of imperfect measurements, but a fundamental constraint rooted
                                            in the structure of the system.
										</p>
										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										Complementarity in photography does not raise any metaphysical concerns, as it
                                            does not apply to individual pixels but to the image they collectively form.
                                            The situation becomes conceptually troubling, however, when complementarity
                                            arises in the context of properties attributed to single physical entities.
                                            This is precisely the case with photons, the fundamental constituents of
                                            light.

										The ability of a photon to pass through a specific type of filter, called a
                                            polarizer, is associated with a property called polarization. A polarizer
                                            can be oriented in any direction. For instance, if a polarizer is oriented
                                            vertically and a photon passes through it, the photon is
                                            said to be vertically polarized, and analogously for any other orientation.
                                            When a photon is known to be polarized in a certain orientation, such as
                                            vertically, and is then sent through a polarizer oriented orthogonally,
                                            i.e., horizontally, the photon is blocked (as
                                            illustrated in the left panel of Figure 2).<sup><a href="#footnotea" id="fnrefa">a</a></sup>
                                            Interestingly, if a vertically polarized photon is sent through a polarizer
                                            tilted at 45 degrees
                                            (as illustrated in the right panel of Figure 2), it
                                            passes through with 50% probability, and if the same photon is subsequently
                                            sent through a vertical polarizer, it again passes through with 50%
                                            probability. This behavior indicates that the property associated with the
                                            binary distinction between vertical and horizontal outcomes is complementary to the one associated with the
                                            diagonal outcomes, meaning that precise
                                            knowledge of one entails maximum uncertainty about the other. This suggests
                                            that the polarizer does not passively reveal a pre-existing polarization,
                                            but, counterintuitively, that the outcome depends on the orientation of the
                                            polarizer as well.

										<p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
										The existence of complementary properties within a single fundamental particle,
                                            such as a photon, challenges traditional realism, which assumes that
                                            fundamental entities possess definite and intrinsic properties. If two
                                            properties of an entity cannot be independently measured with certainty, can
                                            both truly correspond to real properties? In 1935, a seminal paper by Albert
                                            Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, hereafter referred to as EPR,
                                            explored this issue in depth, proposing the following sufficient criterion
                                            for a property (or quantity, as they refer to it) to be considered an
                                            element of reality:<sup><a href="#citation3" id="citationref3">3</a></sup>

                                        This criterion raises doubts about whether both complementary properties can be
                                            elements of reality, although the situation becomes more nuanced once
                                            <em>entanglement</em> is taken into account. Entanglement between two (or
                                            more) particles is the phenomenon in which measurement outcomes are found to
                                            be correlated across different choices of measurement parameters that
                                            correspond to complementary properties (see Figure 3
                                            for a schematic representation). For example, the polarizations of two
                                            entangled photons can be perfectly correlated when both photons are measured
                                            in the vertical orientation, meaning that either both pass through the
                                            vertical polarizer or both are blocked, but they are also perfectly
                                            correlated when they are measured in a complementary orientation, such as at
                                            45 degrees. This behavior would not occur with two photons that were
                                            explicitly prepared to be vertically polarized, since in that case they
                                            would produce correlations only in the vertical orientation, while
                                            measurements in the complementary orientations would yield completely
                                            random results.

                                        By considering this non-trivial correlation, EPR argued that the outcome of a
                                            measurement on a distant particle could be predicted with certainty, and
                                            without disturbance, by measuring the corresponding property of its
                                            entangled counterpart. Then, relying on <em>counterfactual reasoning</em>,
                                            the assumption that the outcomes of mutually incompatible measurements can
                                            be meaningfully considered, they argued that both properties could in
                                            principle be determined without any uncertainty relation arising between
                                            them, thereby contradicting their complementary nature. This led them to
                                            conclude that quantum mechanics must be an incomplete theory, a conclusion
                                            that initiated a long-standing debate that continues to this day.

                                        In 1964, John Bell took EPR’s objections seriously and suggested the following
                                            setup.<sup><a href="#citation4" id="citationref4">4</a></sup> Two particles
                                            are spatially separated, and for
                                            each, an experimental parameter is freely chosen to determine which of two
                                            complementary properties will be measured (as illustrated in
                                            Figure 3). The procedure is repeated with different
                                            choices of measurement parameters, each time measuring identically prepared
                                            pairs of particles. It should be noted that particles are described as
                                            identically prepared rather than identical, since there is no way of
                                            verifying in advance that they are exactly the same. Seeking to test the
                                            completeness of quantum mechanics, Bell considered the possibility that the
                                            system under investigation possesses additional properties, called
                                            <em>hidden variables</em>, whose existence would supply the missing
                                            information needed to render the theory complete. Relying on counterfactual
                                            reasoning, Bell derived the maximum value of an expression involving all
                                            four possible correlations for two measurement parameters on each side.
                                            The purpose of Bell’s derivation was to construct a testable criterion that
                                            was theoretically expected to be violated by entangled pairs of particles.
                                            This expectation was experimentally confirmed in the 1980s and led to the
                                            2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for the scientists involved. Given this
                                            violation, at least one of the assumptions used in the derivation must be
                                            incorrect.<sup><a href="#footnoteb" id="fnrefb">b</a></sup>
										</p>
                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        The first assumption Bell used in his derivation, called
                                            <em>outcome independence</em>, is that the measurement outcomes are
                                            independent of each other when hidden variables are also taken into account.
                                            This means that the hidden variables of the system provide the missing
                                            information to fully describe each particle separately. The second
                                            assumption, called <em>parameter independence</em>, is that the outcome for
                                            one particle is independent of the measurement parameter chosen for the
                                            other. This reflects the idea that, given enough spatial separation, the
                                            choice of measurement parameter on one particle has no influence on the
                                            other particle. The third assumption, called
                                            <em>measurement independence</em>, is that the system's hidden variables are
                                            independent of the selected measurement parameters. This implies that prior
                                            to the measurement, hidden variables correspond to properties inherent to
                                            the system of particles.

                                        For those who reject counterfactual reasoning, Bell’s criterion poses no
                                            challenge (nor does the EPR argument), as quantum mechanics can then be
                                            regarded as a complete but strictly statistical theory. That view is
                                            adequate for both instrumentalists and structural realists. Traditional
                                            realists, however, cannot avoid counterfactual reasoning in this context,
                                            since, from their perspective, the physical properties <em>a priori</em>
                                            possess definite values, even when the measurements that reveal them are in
                                            practice mutually exclusive.

                                        The denial of outcome independence suggests that entangled particles cannot be
                                            fully described in isolation from one another. Consequently, the measurement
                                            outcome of a particle that is part of an entangled pair may be random when
                                            considered in isolation, but it is correlated with the measurement outcome
                                            of its counterpart. The possibility that entangled systems cannot be fully
                                            described in terms of properties attributed to individual particles is
                                            compatible with instrumentalism and structural realism, but not with
                                            traditional realism. Traditional realists are therefore compelled to account
                                            for the randomness observed in measurements when entangled particles are
                                            considered individually.<sup><a href="#footnotec" id="fnrefc">c</a></sup> One
                                            interpretation suggests that certain measurements are inherently random.
                                            Another proposes that multiple universes exist to realize all possible
                                            measurement outcomes. Both views are unsatisfactory, as they fill
                                            explanatory gaps with <em>ad hoc</em> metaphysical assertions.

                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        Rejecting parameter independence implies a dependence between the outcome for
                                            one particle and the measurement parameter selected for the other, which is
                                            not limited by spatial separation.<sup><a href="#footnoted" id="fnrefd">d</a></sup>
                                            A representative theory that adopts this
                                            perspective is the pilot-wave theory, in which the hidden variables are the
                                            particles’ actual positions, \qqm{guided} by a pilot-wave that acts globally
                                            in the sense that what happens to one particle in general depends on what is
                                            measured on the other. This perspective is fully compatible with traditional
                                            realism. Likewise, it is compatible with instrumentalism and structural
                                            realism, since the mathematical framework can be accepted devoid of
                                            ontological commitments at the level of individual properties.

                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        Finally, rejecting measurement independence allows the hidden variables to
                                            depend on the selected measurement parameters. It is important to note that
                                            this dependence need not be causal in nature, since that would give rise to
                                            paradoxical scenarios such as retro-causality. The rejection of this
                                            assumption is compatible with both instrumentalism and structural realism,
                                            but is incompatible with traditional realism, which is committed to the
                                            existence of inherent properties, meaning properties that do not depend on
                                            the act of measurement.

                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        Based on the above discussion, if any ontological claim about reality is to be
                                            made, structural realism appears to be the most reasonable view. Traditional
                                            realism requires adopting substantial theory-level modifications, as in
                                            pilot-wave theory, and treating them as the new <em>real</em> framework.
                                            This viewpoint can be challenged by a philosophical argument known as
                                            <em>pessimistic induction</em>, which notes that many past theories once
                                            regarded as true were eventually abandoned or subsumed by more comprehensive
                                            theoretical frameworks, suggesting that the same fate may await current
                                            theories. Structural realism, in contrast, maintains that although the
                                            specific concepts employed by successive theories may change, the relational
                                            structure they describe tends to be preserved.

                                        The appeal of structural realism can also be found in cosmology, although, in
                                            the absence of a result analogous to Bell’s criterion, the discussion is
                                            conducted at a higher level. Throughout history, cosmological models have
                                            reflected not only our evolving understanding of the universe but also deep
                                            philosophical assumptions about humanity's place within it. The geocentric
                                            model placed the Earth, and by extension humanity, at the center of the
                                            universe. A major shift in this anthropocentric worldview came with the
                                            adoption of the heliocentric model, which demoted the Earth from its special
                                            position, placing it among the other planets that orbit the Sun.

                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        The anthropocentric worldview, however, was too deeply rooted to disappear from
                                            scientific thought, and it resurfaced in modern cosmology as the
                                            <em>fine-tuning</em> problem. Fine-tuning is based on the premise that the
                                            emergence of life depends on several conditions, including the existence of
                                            long-lived stars and habitable planets. Such conditions appear to be
                                            possible only when certain physical parameters, such as the strengths of the
                                            fundamental forces, lie within a narrow range of values. Thus, the existence
                                            of life on Earth has led many to contemplate the apparent coincidence that
                                            the universe possesses precisely those conditions required for life to arise.

                                        <p class="maintext" lang="en" style="line-height: 1.4;">
                                        Several explanations have been offered to resolve the fine-tuning problem. One
                                            proposes the existence of multiple universes, each with its own set of
                                            fundamental parameters, so that observers inevitably inhabit a universe that
                                            supports their existence. Another appeals to chance, suggesting that the
                                            universe simply happens to possess the right conditions for life. A third
                                            invokes an external designer who \qqm{tuned} Nature’s physical parameters to
                                            values suitable for life. All these explanations rely on traditional realism
                                            since they presuppose that fundamental parameters are independently existing
                                            concepts. From the perspective of structural realism, however, fine-tuning
                                            is a pseudo-problem, since the specific values of the fundamental parameters
                                            need not be regarded as independent features to which values are ascribed by
                                            design, by chance, or by any other mechanism, but rather as quantitative
                                            expressions of an underlying structure. In other words, once certain
                                            entities are conceptualized and then mathematically abstracted, the internal
                                            coherence of Nature is projected onto them.

                                        In the development of any theoretical framework, concepts are introduced
                                            axiomatically and serve as reference points through which relations emerge,
                                            revealing the structure of reality. If anything lies beneath this structure,
                                            it may be, as Baruch Spinoza envisioned, a single substance with innumerable
                                            attributes, an indivisible whole, unified and expressed through all that is
                                            to be observed.

                                            applications, such as in sunglasses, where vertically polarized lenses
                                            reduce glare by blocking reflected light that is horizontally polarized.

                                            criteria formulated over a century earlier by the logician George Boole,

                                            attributed to the unavoidable entanglement they form with the measuring
                                            apparatus.
